=============================================================================
EPIC WRITING GUIDELINES
=============================================================================

An EPIC represents a large strategic initiative that delivers significant business value.
Think: "What major capability or outcome are we building?"

FOCUS ON:
✅ Strategic vision and business goals
✅ High-level scope and boundaries
✅ Expected business outcomes and value
✅ Major stakeholder needs
✅ Success metrics at the portfolio level

AVOID:
❌ Implementation details or technology choices
❌ Code examples or technical specifications
❌ Detailed user stories (those belong in Features)
❌ Step-by-step procedures

GOOD EPIC EXAMPLE:
"Build a collaborative, AI-native requirements management platform that serves as
a single source of truth for software teams using multiple AI assistants. Success
measured by: 95% reduction in requirements drift across AI tools, 3x faster
requirements creation, SOC2 compliance achieved."

BAD EPIC EXAMPLE:
"Create a FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM.
Implement JWT authentication with Keycloak. Set up Docker containers with
docker-compose for deployment."

KEY QUESTIONS TO ASK:
- What business problem does this solve?
- Who are the primary stakeholders?
- How will we measure success?
- What are we explicitly NOT doing?
